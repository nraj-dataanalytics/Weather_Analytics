# Weather Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

## Overview
This is an **individual Power BI analytics project** focused on analyzing and visualizing **weather and air quality data** across multiple cities.  
The project demonstrates end-to-end BI skills, including data preparation, modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard design.

---

## Objective
- Analyze current weather conditions by city
- Visualize short-term (daily and hourly) weather forecasts
- Monitor air quality using AQI and pollutant indicators
- Present insights through a clean, interactive Power BI dashboard

---

## Dashboard Features
- **Current Weather Metrics**
  - Temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed, pressure, UV index
  - Sunrise and sunset timings
  - Last updated timestamp

- **Forecast Analysis**
  - 7-day temperature trends
  - Daily chance of rain
  - Hourly weather trends for detailed analysis

- **Air Quality Insights**
  - AQI score and health category
  - Pollutant levels (PM10, PM2.5, O₃, SO₂, CO, NO₂)

- **Interactive Design**
  - City-based filtering
  - KPI cards, trend charts, and clean UI layout

---

## Data Sources
The dashboard is built using structured Excel files:
- `Current.xlsx` – current weather and air quality data  
- `Forcast_Day.xlsx` – daily weather forecast  
- `Forcast_Hour.xlsx` – hourly forecast data  
- `MasterReport.xlsx` – city metadata (sunrise, sunset, theme)

---

## Data Preparation & Modeling
- Data cleaning and transformation performed using **Power Query**
- Analytical logic implemented using **DAX**
- Structured data model with fact and supporting dimension tables
- Optimized relationships for performance and usability
